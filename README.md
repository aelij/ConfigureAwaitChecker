ConfigureAwait Checker
======================

# ARCHIVED: This functionality has been [added](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/ConfigureAwait_Analysis.html) to JetBrains products.

[ReSharper extension](https://resharper-plugins.jetbrains.com/packages/ConfigureAwaitChecker.v9/) and [Rider plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10948-configureawait-checker) that check for tasks are not awaited using `ConfigureAwait`.

Library code should use `ConfigureAwait(false)` with every await. Always specifying `ConfigureAwait` makes it clearer how the continuation is invoked and avoids synchronization bugs.
